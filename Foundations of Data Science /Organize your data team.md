# RACI Matrix for Data Analytics Tasks

This document outlines the RACI matrix for tasks typically carried out by data professionals within a project. The matrix assigns roles and responsibilities using the RACI framework: Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I).

## Step 2: Assign Responsibility for the First Three Tasks

| **Task**                     | **BI Engineer** | **Data Scientist** | **Analytics Team Manager** | **Data Engineer** |
|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Access to data**           | R               | C                  | R                          | R                 |
| **Create models to analyze data** | C          | R                  | C                          | I                 |
| **Drive insights and recommendations based on data** | C       | R                  | C                          | I                 |

## Step 3: Expand the RACI Matrix by Adding the Chief Data Officer and the New Task

| **Task**                     | **BI Engineer** | **Data Scientist** | **Analytics Team Manager** | **Data Engineer** | **Chief Data Officer** |
|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Access to data**           | R               | C                  | R                          | R                 | A                       |
| **Create models to analyze data** | C          | R                  | C                          | I                 | A                       |
| **Drive insights and recommendations based on data** | C       | R                  | C                          | I                 | A                       |
| **Ensure data compliance**   | C               | I                  | C                          | R                 | A                       |

## Explanation of Roles
